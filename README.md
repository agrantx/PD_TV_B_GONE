⚠️ Power Notes
NRF24L01 modules can be sensitive to power quality.

Use a stable 3.3V supply
Add a 10µF–100µF capacitor between VCC and GND near the module
Do not connect VCC to 5V

Upgrading from Standard CC1101 to E07-433M20S
coming soon
This project can be upgraded from a standard CC1101 module to the E07-433M20S high-power RF transceiver.

What changes are required?
wait for the update
Recommended additions
The E07-433M20S consumes significantly more power than a standard CC1101 module.

Recommended:

Stable 3.3V power supply
Dedicated voltage regulator
100µF–470µF capacitor between VCC and GND
Quality 433MHz antenna
Short power wires and solid grounding
The module can draw around 100mA during transmission at maximum power.

Performance Improvements
The E07-433M20S is based on the CC1101 transceiver and includes a built-in Power Amplifier (PA).

Compared to a standard CC1101 module:

Higher transmit power
Better long-range performance
Improved signal stability
External antenna support
Better performance in noisy RF environments
The module supports up to 20 dBm (100mW) output power and receiver sensitivity down to -109 dBm. EBYTE specifies communication distances of up to approximately 2 km under ideal open-field conditions with a suitable antenna.

Why upgrade?
✔ More transmit power

✔ Better range

✔ Stronger signal reception

✔ External antenna support

✔ Improved reliability

For users who want maximum Sub-GHz performance, the E07-433M20S is a significant upgrade over a standard CC1101 module and is the recommended choice for long-range applications.
